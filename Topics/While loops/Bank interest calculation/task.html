<h2>Bank interest calculation</h2>
<html><body><p>When a bank has financial problems, the government can return a client's deposit if it is less than 700,000. The interest rate for a particular deposit is 7.1% a year. Interest is added to the same deposit at the end of the year, and then a new value of the interest is calculated. Find out how many years it will take for the sum of the deposit to exceed the value protected by the government.</p>
<p>The input format: the initial sum of the deposit.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the value will be between 50,000 and 700,000.</p>
<p>Please note that the deposit amount increases by a value proportional to the interest rate each year – in this case, 1.071 (7.1%). Thus, the formula for calculating the deposit amount will look like this: <code class="java">deposit = deposit * 1.071</code>.</p></body></html><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">650000<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
