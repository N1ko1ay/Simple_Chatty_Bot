<h2>What is the error?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Look at this code. When we run the program, it throws an error. </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    const val CONST = 3_000
    val numberLists = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    numberLists.add(CONST)
    println(numberLists)
}</code></pre>
