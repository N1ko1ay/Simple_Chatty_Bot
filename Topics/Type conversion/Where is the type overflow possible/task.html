<h2>Where is the type overflow possible?</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have an <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> variable. For some reason, you need to convert it to other types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val n: Int = ... // it has some value
</code></pre>
<p>Select one or more lines where type overflow is possible.</p>
