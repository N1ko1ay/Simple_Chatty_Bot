<p>Now she wants to make this tree interactive. First, she wants the program to be able to determine the relationship between herself and a random family member. How many <strong>if</strong> expressions will Annie need to use to find out the relationship between herself and her random family member? For this, the program can use information about the person's parents (compare two people's parents) and gender (male or female).</p>
